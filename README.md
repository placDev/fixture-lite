# fixtures-manager <!-- omit in toc -->

**typeorm-fixture-builder** was created when I struggled with the current fixture solutions for typeorm avaible. They simply didn't fit my needs and/or weren't flexible enough. So I decided to create another one.

- [Installation](#installation)

# Installation

Install `typeorm-fixture-builder` and it's peer dependencies. Usually you will install `typescript` as dev dependency:

```sh
yarn add typeorm typeorm-fixture-builder
yarn add -D typescript
```

This will give you access to the `fixtures` cli utitlity as also to the programmatic api.
